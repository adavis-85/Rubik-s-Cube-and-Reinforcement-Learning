# Rubik's Cube and Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is not a very effective way to solve a Rubik's cube.  A better way would be Kociemba's Algorithm for example.  A better use of reinforcement learning would be in training a computer to play a video game or to autonomously drive a car.  The following code is able to effectively solve a cube that is within 8-9 moves away from a solved cube.  This is achieved by scrambling a completed cube with 8-9 moves.  The code is ran until the cube is solved and is then proven to be solved.  This is also timed.
